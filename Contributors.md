[Michiganâ€™s Center for Educational Performance and Information (CEPI)](https://www.michigan.gov/cepi/) is the first OSC member to expand the CEDS Data Warehouse beyond ED*Facts* reporting, adding Dual Enrollment and Early Middle College programs and postsecondary enrollment and attainment data elements. CEPI is adding new dimensions and fact tables to the CEDS Data Warehouse, building repeatable processes for developing and loading data to the model, and contributing new element definitions to CEDS.  They are expending their own resources, using their development and database architecture staff to make the Data Warehouse available to the CEDS Open Source Community. 

Before CEPI, the [Center for the Integration of IDEA Data](https://ciidta.grads360.org/#program) (CIID), through a grant from the Office of Special Education, created the CEDS Data Warehouse with the development of [Generate](https://ciidta.grads360.org/#program/generate). Generate, an EDFacts reporting application, began by using the CEDS Integrated Data Store (IDS) to integrate data from multiple sources for EDFacts reporting but needed the ability to retrieve data quickly out of the system which prompted the first iteration of the CEDS Data Warehouse. For several years, under CIID through the Generate application, the CEDS Data Warehouse was field tested. The [Nevada Department of Education](http://www.doe.nv.gov/) was the pilot state for Generate and assisted in several iterations, updates, and enhancements to Generate. Their efforts, along with other states implementing Generate, helped the CIID team improve the CEDS Data Warehouse structure.

In the next few years, CEDS will continue to work with stakeholders to find ways to bring the community together. The CEDS team is excited to continue to partner with you, the community, in this new era.

This version of the CEDS Data Warehouse has been updated primarily by the CIID development staff. An update to this version is anticipated in late September 2021 based on work done through the CEDS Data Warehouse Expansion Project (https://ceds.communities.ed.gov/#communities/ceds-osc/workgroups/ceds-dw-expansion)
