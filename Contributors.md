[Michigan’s Center for Educational Performance and Information (CEPI)](https://www.michigan.gov/cepi/) is the first OSC member to expand the CEDS Data Warehouse beyond ED*Facts* reporting, adding Dual Enrollment and Early Middle College programs and postsecondary enrollment and attainment data elements. CEPI is adding new dimensions and fact tables to the CEDS Data Warehouse, building repeatable processes for developing and loading data to the model, and contributing new element definitions to CEDS.  They are expending their own resources, using their development and database architecture staff to make the Data Warehouse available to the CEDS Open Source Community. 

Before CEPI, the [Center for the Integration of IDEA Data](https://ciidta.grads360.org/#program) (CIID), through a grant from the Office of Special Education, created the CEDS Data Warehouse with the development of [Generate](https://ciidta.grads360.org/#program/generate). Generate, an EDFacts reporting application, began by using the CEDS Integrated Data Store (IDS) to integrate data from multiple sources for EDFacts reporting but needed the ability to retrieve data quickly out of the system which prompted the first iteration of the CEDS Data Warehouse. For several years, under CIID through the Generate application, the CEDS Data Warehouse was field tested. The [Nevada Department of Education](http://www.doe.nv.gov/) was the pilot state for Generate and assisted in several iterations, updates, and enhancements to Generate. Their efforts, along with other states implementing Generate, helped the CIID team improve the CEDS Data Warehouse structure.

Version 9.1.0.0 was updated primarily based on work done through the CEDS Data Warehouse Expansion Project (https://ceds.communities.ed.gov/#communities/ceds-osc/workgroups/ceds-dw-expansion)
Contributions from [The Colorado Department of Education](https://www.cde.state.co.us/) and [Michigan's Center for Educational Performance and Infomration (CEPI)](https://www.michigan.gov/cepi/) resulted in additions and insight into the special education and adult education use cases. Additionally [Double Line](https://wearedoubleline.com/) assisted in the build out of the metadata tagging you will find in the dimension tables. Search the extended properties of the Dimension tables to find the associated CEDS element information. Numerous other stakeholders from state education agencies, local education agencies and the vendor community contributed through participation in meetings throughout the project and providing insight into the special education and adult education use cases that made up the scope of the project. It is the CEDS community of stakeholders that make all of this possible.

Version 10.0.0.0 contains contributions from [Michigan's Center for Educational Performance and Infomration (CEPI)](https://www.michigan.gov/cepi/) as well as improved alignment to standard naming conventions and expansion of the metadata tagging in extended properties and increased population of the junk dimension tables. 

CEDS is continuing to work with stakeholders to continue expansion of the Data Warehouse. The next version is expected to contain tables related to finace data with contributions from Maine, Missouri, and Michigan as well as many other stakeholders. The CEDS team is excited to continue to partner with you, the community, in this new era.
